5. For the Order Form, if user click on a price on 'Order Book' (any side), 
   the price will be automatically updated on 'New Order' - `Price` field. 
   Basically, if users would like to buy, they will select the best price for buying, 
   which is the cheapest price of what are being sold on 'Order Book' (the bottom order of 'sell' side of 'Order Book').

   For this, users will select the best price for selling, which is the highest price of what are on bid on 'Order Book' 
   (the top order of 'buy' side of 'Order Book').
